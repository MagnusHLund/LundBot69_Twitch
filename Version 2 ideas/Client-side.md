   Once a tab on the navbar is clicked, the appropriate GUI appears on the right side, of the navbar, which then requires the app to get an increased width.

-  Overall better visuals. The grey backgrounds, the buttons, everything is ugly in version 1.
-  Save the volume slider positions, locally. Load them on startup, so the volumes are at the user preferred value.
