Whole new GUI:
-  Instead of extra windows, it should by default be a navbar on the left side.
   Once a tab on the navbar is clicked, the appropriate GUI appears on the right side, of the navbar, which then requires the app to get an increased width.
-  Song request video can work as a stream overlay (somehow?)
-  Overall better visuals. The grey backgrounds, the buttons, everything is ugly in version 1.
