Trying to create a Twitch bot for 2 friends of mine, whom stream on twitch.

Using React with Typescript, redux + thunks for my web application, which serves as a dashboard.
Mainly because i want to get more React experience, due to relevancy at my current job.

API is PHP, which was a tough choice between either that or node.js. However for job relevancy, php made the most sense to practise.

Bot itself is gonna be node.js based, using plain old javascript, rather than typescript.
